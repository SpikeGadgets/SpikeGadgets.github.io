# Our Mission

To develop the most advanced neuroscience tools on the market, while preserving ease of use and science-driven customization.

SpikeGadgets is trying something new. Our hybrid approach is to design and sell powerful hardware that interfaces with an open-source software platform supported by a large community of scientists and developers. Our goal is to support the efforts of the open-source community in a commercially-sustainable way.
