#Export Functions

Export functions are utilities that will extract and save specific features from a raw recording file (.rec) into a binary file. 

These features are meant to be used in terminal with arguments passed to specify various parameters. They can also be called from other scripting languages ('!' character in Matlab is used for this). See extractSpikeBinaryFiles.m (in TrodesToMatlab toolbox) for an example of how to wrap export functions inside Matlab.

###Importing to Matlab

TrodesToMatlab toolbox can be [downloaded here](https://bitbucket.org/mkarlsso/trodes/downloads/).

All extracted binary files can be read into Matlab using a single function: readTrodesExtractedDataFile.m (in the TrodesToMatlab toolbox).  This function will read the file's header info and data into a Matlab structure.

###Importing to Python

TrodesToPython toolbox can be [downloaded here](https://bitbucket.org/mkarlsso/trodes/downloads/).

All extracted binary files can be read into Python using a single function: readTrodesExtractedDataFile.py (in the TrodesToPython toolbox).  This function will read the file's header info and data. 

 
###Basic usage

```
#!sh

./exportLFP -rec /path/to/recording.rec -OPTION1 VALUE1 -OPTION2 VALUE2 ...
```
Following the executable, a recording (.rec) file needs to be passed with the -rec option. 

##More Options
By default, the export functions will use the settings defined when recording the data. But you can override these via command line options. Some export functions will different defaults, and can be seen by typing -h. 

All export functions will output a version of the following with the -h argument.
 
The *Defaults* displays any default values that will override the settings in the workspace and arguments passed. 

The *Additional options* section displays any extra options this specific export function will provide. 


```
#!text
./exportLFP -h

Used to extract LFP data from a raw rec file and save to individual files. 
Usage:  exportLFP -rec INPUTFILENAME OPTION1 VALUE1 OPTION2 VALUE2 ...  

Input arguments 
Defaults:
    -outputrate 1500 
    -highpass 0 
    -lowpass 400 
    -interp -1 (inf) 
    -userefs 0 

Additional options: 
-oneperntrode <0 or 1>          -- if 1 (default) only the LFP channel is used for each ntrode. Otherwise all channels are exported.

Input arguments

-rec <filename>                 -- Recording filename. Required. Muliple -rec <filename> entries can be used to append data in output.
-output <basename>              -- The base name for the output files. If not specified, the base name of the first .rec file is used. 
-outputdirectory <directory>    -- A root directory to extract output files to (default is directory of .rec file). 
-reconfig <filename>            -- Use a different workspace than the one embedded in the recording file. 
-v or -version                  -- Prints the current executable's version information to the terminal. 

By default, the following options will use the settings in the workspace, unless specified above.
-highpass <integer>             -- High pass filter value. Overrides settings in file. 
-lowpass <integer>              -- Low pass filter value. Overrides settings in file.
-outputrate <integer>           -- Define the output sampling rate in the output file(s).
-interp <integer>               -- Maximum number of dropped packets to interpolate. 
-userefs <1 or 0>               -- Whether or not to subtract digital references.
-usespikefilters <1 or 0>       -- Whether or not to apply the spike filter settings in the file. 
-abortbaddata <1 or 0>          -- Whether or not to abort export if data appears corrupted. 
-paddingbytes <integer>         -- Used to add extra bytes to the expected packet size if an override is required

```
##Troubleshooting

**Error with file: backwards timestamp**

This message is displayed if the timestamp is not increasing correctly, and causes the export to abort. It can sometimes occur at the beginning of the file once (and is then not a problem). Rerun the export function with the -abortbaddata 0 flag.  If multiple warnings are displayed as the export progresses there may be some corruption in the file.
