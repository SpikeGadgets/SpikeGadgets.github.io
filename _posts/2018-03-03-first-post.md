SpikeGadgets is considering of moving over to GitHub. While Bitbucket has worked for us, Github may prove more useful to us in the future. Home to more free and open source projects, users, and features, Github is a larger provider of free and open source software, especially popular amongst researchers. Not only do we currently support Trodes, modules, and export programs, in the future we plan to also provide to our users a networking API, integration with Neuroscience Without Borders, Python libraries, and integration with other popular open source neuroscience tools.

For now, our Github will be used as a base for random libraries and projects, updates on our software, and documentation. Even though both Github and Bitbucket have wiki functionality, they are difficult to use to edit, hard to find, and ugly to look at. Putting it here may be a better alternative. In fact, moving our entire software page here is another idea to consider. Until then...

Coming soon: posts on the newest Trodes release 1.7.2, current projects in our software, and future projects.

<!-- You can write regular [markdown](http://markdowntutorial.com/) here and Jekyll will automatically convert it to a nice webpage.  I strongly encourage you to [take 5 minutes to learn how to write in markdown](http://markdowntutorial.com/) - it'll teach you how to transform regular text into bold/italics/headings/tables/etc.

**Here is some bold text**

## Here is a secondary heading

Here's a useless table:

| Number | Next number | Previous number |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Five | Six | Four |
| Ten | Eleven | Nine |
| Seven | Eight | Six |
| Two | Three | One |


How about a yummy crepe?

![Crepe](http://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cQ1Yoa75m2yUFFbY2xwuqw/348s.jpg)

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}

## Boxes
You can add notification, warning and error boxes like this:

### Notification

{: .box-note}
**Note:** This is a notification box.

### Warning

{: .box-warning}
**Warning:** This is a warning box.

### Error

{: .box-error}
**Error:** This is an error box. -->
